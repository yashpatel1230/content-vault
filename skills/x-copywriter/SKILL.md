name: x-copywriter
description: Draft X (Twitter) tweets and threads. You may be new to X · this skill teaches the platform's culture as it drafts and writes in the register of GTM build-in-public founders, not in your LinkedIn voice. Pulls hook patterns and structure from a corpus of high-engagement tweets by @romanbuildsaas, @MichLieben, @itsalexvacca. Hard ban on em dashes, hashtags, and LinkedIn imports. Use when asked to "write a tweet", "draft an x post", "x thread on X", "tweet about Y", or "/x-copywriter".

# x-copywriter

Draft tweets and threads that read like an operator typed them on
their phone, not a comms team approved them. **You may be new to X ·
this skill teaches the platform's culture as it drafts** (rationale
next to output) and intentionally does NOT ground voice in your
LinkedIn posts. The voice anchors are three reference accounts: Romàn
(@romanbuildsaas, metrics-first), Michel Lieben (@MichLieben, story
+ self-roast), Alex Vacca (@itsalexvacca, operator-with-receipts).
Their actual top tweets live in `reference-corpus.md`. Platform
culture rules live in `culture-brief.md`.

---

## When to invoke

Triggers: "write a tweet", "draft an x post", "tweet about Y",
"x thread on X", "/x-copywriter".

Do **not** use for:

- LinkedIn posts. The voices are different and you'll drift if you
  mix.
- Long-form (newsletter, blog).
- Replies to other people's tweets. Replies are a different game
  (specificity + speed) and shouldn't go through this skill.

---

## Workflow

### 1. Brief

One batched prompt:

```
Quick brief.

1. What's this tweet about? (milestone, lesson, hot take, 
   build-in-public, IP-giveaway, self-roast, etc.)
2. The single specific fact, number, or scar that anchors it. 
   Be concrete. ("crossed $50k MRR yesterday" beats "growing 
   nicely"). If we don't have a number, can we add one?
3. Solo tweet or thread? If unsure, I'll pick.
4. Anything off-limits? (NDA pre-launch features, exact ARR if 
   we're being cagey, etc.)
```

If the user already gave enough, skip the prompt and parse.

### 2. Pick the format

Default decisions:

- **Solo tweet** by default. Most ideas should ship solo. Threads
  are reserved for ideas that genuinely need 4-7 beats.
- **Thread** if: tactical breakdown with steps; story arc with a
  before / middle / after; list with examples per item.
- **Two solo tweets** beats a 3-tweet thread. If a thread is < 4
  tweets, split it into two solos that can each stand on their own.

### 3. Pick the hook

Match the brief to one of these 8 patterns. All come from the
reference corpus. Read `reference-corpus.md` if you haven't recently.

| # | Pattern | Anchor | Example |
|---|---------|--------|---------|
| H1 | Bare metric, no preamble | Roman | "Gojiberry AI just hit $2M ARR." (1.7k likes) |
| H2 | Volume credential + one mistake | Alex | "After 3,200+ outbound campaigns at ColdIQ, the most expensive mistake we see is..." |
| H3 | Year-over-year decline stat | Alex | "Cold emails needed for one positive reply: 2023: ~120 / 2024: ~200 / 2025: ~430" (460 likes) |
| H4 | Self-roast comparison | Mich | "spent 3 weeks building a campaign that AI just did in 15 min from a single link." |
| H5 | Quoted strawman + receipts | Mich/Alex | "'cold email is dead' meanwhile us: same emails, same volume, $30k → $550k months" / "'services don't scale' > chases the $10k software budget..." |
| H6 | Failure stack → outcome | Mich | "Got fired from 4 jobs. Failed at 7 startups. Lost $40K. Then I bought coldiq(dot)com..." |
| H7 | IP-giveaway hook | Mich/Alex | "I'm giving away the [exact thing] we use to [specific result]." (4k+ likes when nailed) |
| H8 | Mock-formal industry obit | Alex | "i regret to inform you that cold outbound has been definitively solved. the study cost 23,000,000 sends. the findings fit in 5 bullet points." |

**Hooks to never use on X (LinkedIn imports):**

- "Excited to announce..."
- "Thrilled to share..."
- "Big news!"
- "Here are 7 lessons from..." (as solo tweet, not thread hook)
- "Most people think X. They're wrong." (LinkedIn cliché now even
  on X)
- "Day 1 at..." career update
- Any hook that needs a "1/" because the actual idea hasn't started

### 4. Pick the body shape

**For solo tweets**, pick one of:

**S1. Bare metric + 1-line context.** 60-100 chars total.
> "We just hit $1.5M ARR with GojiberryAI"
> "227,744 views. 3,316 comments. 477 leads. In 7 days. One Claude system."

**S2. Number stack with line breaks.** 3-5 numbers, one per line,
no bullets. Closes with one short opinion or implication line.
> "We turned 24 employees into LinkedIn influencers in 90 days.
>
> 581 posts.
> 43,473 reactions.
> 28,130 comments.
> 27 new clients worth $153K in MRR."

**S3. Quoted strawman + counter.** Open with the cliché in quotes.
Follow with `>` or hyphen-prefixed lines that demolish it. Lowercase
fine here.
> "'services don't scale'
>
> > chases the $10k software budget inside companies
> > watches openai kill the feature in 3 months
> > cpo title before a paying user, 18 months burning runway"

**S4. Single-line shitpost.** 1 line, lowercase, no follow-up.
No CTA. The whole point is the line.
> "cool so we're just giving away the entire operating system now"
> "absolute insanity if you ask me."

**S5. Numbered listicle.** 3-5 short clauses, one per line.
Sentence case, period or no period at end (consistent within
tweet). Title line first.
> "3 things i wish i knew at $0 ARR:
>
> 1. distribution > product
> 2. write the offer before the code
> 3. one channel, all in"

**For threads**, pick one of:

**T1. Tactical breakdown.** Hook tweet (works alone). 4-6 step
tweets, each one numbered (`2/`, `3/`, etc.) or unnumbered. Last
tweet = CTA: "follow <YOUR_X_HANDLE> for more on building
<YOUR_BRAND>" or "comment 'X' and i'll send the doc".

**T2. Story thread.** Hook = scar / failure stack. Beat tweets
walk the arc: bottom → turning point → current state. End with the
lesson + soft follow CTA.

**T3. List thread.** Hook = "X mistakes I see at $Y ARR companies"
or "Y plays we ran for 100+ clients". Each subsequent tweet = one
item with a one-line example. End with a "want the full doc?"
giveaway CTA or a follow CTA.

### 5. Voice register

**Use lowercase when:**

- Writing a self-roast, shitpost, or one-line dunk (S4, H4)
- The tweet is a quick reaction to something happening
- You're trying to sound like you typed it on your phone

**Use sentence case when:**

- Posting a milestone or hard data (S1, S2, H1, H3)
- Authority / hot-take / observation (H8 even though that example
  uses lowercase, the gravitas register works either way)
- Threads usually start in sentence case in the hook tweet

**Mix is normal.** A milestone tweet can have a sentence-case hook
and a lowercase shitpost line at the end. Don't over-engineer it.

**Punctuation:**

- Periods at the end of sentences are fine. Many high-performers
  drop the final period in casual mode.
- Line breaks: 1-2 max in a solo tweet, more freely in threads.
- Em dashes (`—`): never. **Hard ban**, project-wide rule.
- Smart quotes: never. Straight quotes only.
- Ellipsis: use `...` if needed at all.
- `>` for nested bullet / quoted-cliché lists (Mich/Alex use this).
- `→` for sub-arrow bullets in threads (sparingly).

**Vocabulary to use:**

- Plain English. "use" not "leverage". "help" not "empower".
- Numerals always. "3x", "$2M", "23,000,000 sends".
- Tool names with their canonical casing (Claude Code, Cursor,
  Instantly.ai, HeyReach, Clay, Apollo, n8n, Stripe).
- "Build", "ship", "drop", "spin up". Active verbs.
- Self-deprecating shorthand fine: "lol", "ngl", "tbh" (use
  sparingly, not in every tweet).

### 6. CTA patterns

**Most tweets need no CTA.** The post is the asset. Forced CTAs are
the strongest LinkedIn-import tell.

When you do add one, pick one of:

**CTA-A. Comment-and-send (giveaway only).**
```
Comment '<KEYWORD>' and I'll send the [thing].
```
Variant: "Repost ♻️ + comment 'X' and I'll send it." The
repost-gate is X-native and works.

**CTA-B. Follow for more (threads).** Last tweet of a thread.
```
follow <YOUR_X_HANDLE> for more on building <YOUR_BRAND> in public.
```

**CTA-C. RT the first tweet (threads).** Equivalent of the LinkedIn
"share if useful" but X-native.
```
RT the first tweet if this was useful.
```

**CTA-D. None.** Default for solo tweets. Authority posts and
shitposts work better with no ask.

**Banned closers (LinkedIn import):**

- "Agree?"
- "Thoughts?"
- "What do you think? Drop a 👇 in comments."
- "Tag someone who needs this."
- "Save this for later."
- "Like and follow for more value."
- "Hope this helps."

### 7. Slop scrub (mandatory pre-output)

Before showing the draft, scan it. Any hit → rewrite.

**Punctuation:**
- ❌ Em dash `—`. Never. Replace with period, comma, colon, parens,
  or `>` arrow.
- ❌ Smart/curly quotes. Straight only.
- ❌ Ellipsis character `…`. Use `...`.
- ❌ Multiple hashtags. Or one hashtag. **Zero hashtags on X.**

**Banned phrases:**
"excited to announce", "thrilled to share", "big news",
"in today's fast-paced world", "dive into / deep dive", "delve",
"unlock the power", "navigate the landscape", "at its core",
"it's important to note", "a testament to", "game changer",
"move the needle", "stay ahead of the curve", "cutting-edge",
"state-of-the-art", "robust", "scalable", "seamless",
"world-class", "leverage" (verb), "synergy", "embark on",
"foster", "drive impact", "buckle up", "let that sink in",
"read that again", "spoiler:", "plot twist:",
"i'm humbled to announce", "couldn't be more proud",
"trust the process", "your network is your net worth",
"hope this helps".

**Banned structural slop:**
- ❌ "Here's the thing:" / "Here's the kicker:" / "Here's the catch:"
- ❌ Negation pivot 3+ times in one tweet ("It's not X. It's Y. It's
  not about A. It's about B.")
- ❌ Tricolons of parallel verbs in every line ("listen, adapt,
  deliver. faster, cheaper, better.")
- ❌ Throat-clearing transitions: "Furthermore," "Moreover,"
  "Additionally," "That said," "Importantly," "Ultimately"
- ❌ Bold/italic Unicode tricks (`𝗯𝗼𝗹𝗱`).
- ❌ Keycap emoji as numbered headers (1️⃣ 2️⃣). Plain `1.` or `1)`.
- ❌ Emoji as bullet markers (🚀 ✨ 💡). Inline emoji only, max 1
  per tweet.
- ❌ Tagging 5+ people in one tweet.

**Length scrub:**
- Solo tweet must be ≤ 280 chars. Count it. Show the count in the
  output metadata.
- If a solo tweet hits 240-280, try cutting 1-2 words. Tight beats
  full.

### 8. Output

Show the draft in fenced code blocks. For each piece, include below
the block:

- **Format:** solo tweet · thread · list thread, etc.
- **Char count** (if solo): `247 / 280`.
- **Hook pattern used:** e.g. "H4 · self-roast comparison"
- **Body shape used:** e.g. "S2 · number stack with line breaks"
- **Voice register:** lowercase / sentence case / mixed
- **Slop scrub:** "0 hits" or list any flags caught + how rewritten
- **Why it works (X-specific):** 1-2 sentences explaining what
  makes this read as native X, not LinkedIn (this is the teaching
  layer for a newbie).
- **One alt hook** the user can swap in.

For threads, output every tweet in its own code block, char-counted
individually. Note the **hook tweet must work standalone** before
moving on.

Default output: 1 solo tweet + 1 alt solo tweet from a different
hook pattern. If the brief asks for a thread, deliver the thread
plus 1 solo tweet variant (in case the thread idea works better as
a single tweet).

Do **not** add commentary like "Hope this works!" or "Let me know
if you want changes." Just the drafts + metadata.

## Editing mode

If the user pastes a draft and asks to "make it sound less LinkedIn"
or "fix the slop":

1. Read the draft.
2. Run the slop scrub (§7). Flag every hit inline.
3. Rewrite to a hook + body shape from §3-§4.
4. Output the rewrite + a diff-style list of what changed and why.

---

## Repurpose context (when called from a repurpose orchestrator)

If invoked with a `source` reference (master content row, transcript
excerpt, or external URL):

1. Treat the source as the **insight bank**. Pick one hook / data
   point / hot take · don't rephrase the whole thing.
2. Open with the punch (a number, a contrarian line, a one-word setup),
   not with "I just published a webinar." X has zero patience for
   self-promo openers.
3. If the source is rich (multi-step framework, breakdown), prefer a
   thread. If it's a single insight, prefer a solo tweet.
4. Soft-reference the master only if it earns the slot (e.g., a thread
   tail with "full breakdown: <link>") · don't bolt it on otherwise.
5. Output the draft as usual. The orchestrator handles creating the
   tracking row and pasting `Source: <URL>` at the top of the page
   body · don't include that line yourself.

---

## Cadence guidance (when user asks)

If the user asks "what should I post today?" or "how often should I
tweet?", point them at `culture-brief.md` §6 (3-5 posts/day under 1k
followers, 70/30 reply-to-original ratio, Tue-Thu mornings for B2B
threads, pin a thread, don't quit at month 2).

Do not write a daily content calendar inside this skill. Drafting
is per-tweet. Strategy is in `culture-brief.md`.

---

## Reference files

- `reference-corpus.md`. **Voice anchor.** Top 15 tweets per
  reference creator (Romàn, Mich, Alex), pulled from the X API and
  sorted by weighted engagement. Re-read before drafting if you've
  been off-task. Refresh quarterly with the curl command at the
  bottom of this file.
- `culture-brief.md`. **Platform rulebook.** What X rewards / kills,
  voice register, cadence, reference-account stylistic reads.
  Pointer here when the user asks platform questions.
- This `SKILL.md`. Drafting workflow + hook/body/CTA patterns +
  slop blacklist.

**Important:** Your LinkedIn corpus (e.g.
`<YOUR_LINKEDIN_CORPUS_PATH>`) is **not** a voice source for X.
The two platforms are different games. Don't import LinkedIn voice
fingerprints (the `:)` smiley, `[1] [2]` walking-CTAs, "Lead Gen
Bros", `→` heavy bullets) into X drafts. Your default lane on X
starts closest to @itsalexvacca's operator-with-receipts register,
with seasoning from @MichLieben's self-roast and @romanbuildsaas's
bare-metric format. **Default voice anchors. You can swap or weight
differently** as you find your own taste over time.

---

## Refresh the reference corpus

Run quarterly. Updates `reference-corpus.md`.

```bash
# Requires X API v2 bearer token in env as <YOUR_X_BEARER_TOKEN>
# e.g. export X_BEARER_TOKEN=AAAA...

# user IDs (cached from initial setup):
# romanbuildsaas: 1893653481858433024
# MichLieben:     512156315
# itsalexvacca:   859850213015597056

for uid in 1893653481858433024 512156315 859850213015597056; do
  curl -s "https://api.twitter.com/2/users/${uid}/tweets?max_results=100&tweet.fields=public_metrics,created_at&exclude=retweets,replies" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${X_BEARER_TOKEN}" \
    -o /tmp/x_${uid}.json
done
```

Then sort by `like_count + 3*retweet_count + 2*reply_count + 3*quote_count`,
pick top 15 per creator (filter URL-only tweets), and overwrite
`reference-corpus.md` keeping the same shape.
